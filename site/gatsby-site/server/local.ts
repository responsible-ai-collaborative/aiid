     * Configures permissions for the GraphQL API using graphql-shield.
     * This configuration starts with all fields being private (denied access) and requires explicit permission settings for each field.
     * 
     * The `shield` function is used to define the permissions for queries and mutations, with default access set to deny (`deny`).
     * Permissions are then selectively granted using specific permissions configurations (e.g., `quickAddsPermissions`, `reportsPermissions`).
     * 
     * @constant
     * @type {RuleTree}
     * 
     * @property {Object} Query - Permissions for Query fields. All fields are denied access by default, with specific permissions set explicitly.
     * @property {Object} Mutation - Permissions for Mutation fields. All fields are denied access by default, with specific permissions set explicitly.
     * @property {boolean} allowExternalErrors - Determines whether to allow external errors to be displayed. Set to `true` or based on the environment.
     *                                           This helps in debugging by providing more detailed error messages during development.
