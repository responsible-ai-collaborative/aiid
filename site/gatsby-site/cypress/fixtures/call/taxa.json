        "description": "# What is the CSET Taxonomy?\n\nThe Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) taxonomy is a general taxonomy of AI incidents. There are a large number of classified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, industry, geography, timing, and cost.All classifications within the CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and reviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are finalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and the completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET taxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, the CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to report any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the [Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work similarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. Use the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to find the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click the desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven research at the intersection of security and technology, providing nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is currently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET seeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read more)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

The aim of datasheets is to increase dataset transparency and facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers (e.g., those using datasets to train machine learning models). Datasheets encourage dataset creators to carefully reflect on the dataset creation process, enabling them to uncover possible sources of bias in their data or unintentional assumptions that they’ve made. For dataset consumers, the information contained within datasheets can help ensure that the dataset is the right choice for the task at hand. Datasheets can optionally be exposed to end users for increased transparency and trust. Datasheets contain questions about dataset motivation, composition, collection, pre-processing, labeling, intended uses, distribution, and maintenance. Crucially, and unlike other tools for meta-data extraction, datasheets are not automated, but are intended to capture information known only to the dataset creators and often lost or forgotten over time.

                "long_description": "Many organizations have published principles to guide the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, but they are largely left to practitioners to put them into practice. Other organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, including checklists for specific concepts, such as fairness.\n\n Checklists in other domains, such as aviation, medicine, and structural engineering, have had well-documented success in saving lives and improving professional practices. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners’ needs, they may be misused or ignored.\n\n The fairness checklist research project explores how checklists may be designed to support the development of more fair AI products and services. To do this, we work with AI practitioners who the checklists are intended to support, to solicit their input on the checklist design and support the adoption and integration of the checklist into AI design, development, and deployment lifecycles.\n\n Our first studies in this project have led to a fairness checklist co-designed with practitioners, as well as insights into how organizational and team processes shape how AI teams address fairness harms.
