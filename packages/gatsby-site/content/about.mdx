# Why "AI Incidents"?

Intelligent systems are currently prone to unforeseen and often dangerous failures when they are deployed to the real world. Much like the transportation sector before it (e.g., [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident/) and [FARS](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)) and more recently [computer systems](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), intelligent systems require a repository of problems experienced in the real world so that future researchers and developers may mitigate or avoid repeated bad outcomes.

# What is an Incident?

The initial set of more than 1,000 incident reports have been intentionally broad in nature. Current examples include,

* An *autonomous car* [kills a pedestrian](/cite/4)
* A *trading algorithm* causes a market "[flash crash](/cite/28)" where billions of dollars transfer between parties
* A *facial recognition system* [causes an innocent person to be arrested](/cite/74)

You are invited to [explore the incidents collected to date](/apps/discover), [view the complete listing](/summaries/incidents), and [submit](/apps/submit) additional incident reports. Researchers are invited to review our [working definition of AI incidents](/research/1-criteria).

# Current and Future Users

The database is a [constantly evolving](/research/2-roadmap) [data product](/develop) and [collection of applications](/apps).

* **Current Users** include system architects, industrial product developers, public relations managers, [researchers](/research), and public policy researchers. These users are invited to use the [Discover](/apps/discover) application to proactively discover how recently deployed intelligent systems have produced unexpected outcomes in the real world. In so doing, they may avoid making similar mistakes in their development.
* **Future Uses** will [evolve](/research/2-roadmap) through the code contributions of the [open source](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid) community, including additional database [summaries](/summaries) and [taxonomies](/research/2-roadmap).

# When Should You Report an Incident?

When in doubt of whether an event qualifies as an incident, please [submit it](/apps/submit)! This project is intended to converge on a [shared definition](/research/1-criteria) of "AI Incident" through exploration of the candidate incidents submitted by the broader community.
