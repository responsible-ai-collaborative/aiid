Welcome to this month’s edition of The Monthly Roundup, a newsletter designed to give you a digestible recap on the latest incidents and reports of the AI Incident Database.

This month we are diving deeper into ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs), whose incidents are annotated with the 💬 icon.

Estimated reading time: 6 minutes

## 🗞️ New Incidents

Emerging incidents that occurred last month:

[**Incident #446**: ShotSpotter Failed to Alert Authorities of Mass Shooting in North Carolina](/cite/446)

- **What happened?** ShotSpotter did not detect gunshots and alert Durham police of a drive-by shooting in Durham, North Carolina which left five people in the hospital on New Year's Day.
- **About the AI**: ShotSpotter classifies using sensor data audio events as potential gunshots, triangulates the event's location, and alerts authorities of the event.

[💬 **Incident #452**: ChatGPT-Written Bug Reports Deemed "Nonsense" by White Hat Platform, Prompted Bans](/cite/452)

- **What happened?** ChatGPT-generated responses submitted to smart contract bug bounty platform Immunefi reportedly lacked details to help diagnose technical issues, which reportedly wasted the platform's time, prompting bans to submitters.

[**Incident #453**: Twitter's AI Moderation Tool Misidentified Rockets as Pornography](/cite/453)

- **What happened?** Twitter's automated content moderation misidentified images of rocket launches as pornographic content, prompting incorrect account suspensions.

[**Incident #459**: Firefighters Smashed Cruise AV's Front Window to Stop It from Running over Fire Hoses](/cite/459)

- **What happened?** Local firefighters were only able to stop a Cruise AV from driving over fire hoses that were in use in an active fire scene when they shattered its front window.

## 🗄 From the Archives

Every edition, we feature one or more historical incidents that we find thought-provoking.

In January, we received an influx of incidents involving OpenAI’s newly released ChatGPT. We compiled and analyzed the distinct ChatGPT incidents and derived categories of harms including:

- Academic dishonesty
- Malware development
- Jailbreaking with ease
- Labeler Content Exposure
- Fake citations
- Quality assurance

A detailed analysis from one of our editors will be published shortly on our [blog](/blog/).
