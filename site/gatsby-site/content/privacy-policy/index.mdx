Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (“AIID”) website (“Site”), which is operated by the Responsible AI Collaborative (collectively, “RAIC,” “we”, “us” and/or “our”). We are building a community of contributors and interested parties in order to answer Santayana's aphorism 'those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it'... with data.

This Site provides, among other things, information about our people and organization, as well as information and tools for using the Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (collectively, the “Service”).

Below we explain the type of information that is collected and how the information is used and shared by RAIC, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

Before using the Service, please review this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site or otherwise use the Service.
