Read our month-in-review newsletter recapping new incidents in the AI Incident Database and looking at the trends.

## üóÑ Trending in the AIID

In March the deluge of Deepfake related incidents continued as the public applied generative AI in creative and sometimes destructive ways. In a recent example, [high schoolers created a Deepfake photo](/cite/495) of a principal making violent and racist threats, seeding fears in the community and damaging the principal‚Äôs reputation.

Another trend ¬†is a series of enforcement actions related to privacy, including several arising from the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . Recently, the ¬†Italian Data Protection Authority issued a [ban on ChatGPT](/cite/513/) as well as [Replika‚Äôs AI-powered Chatbot](/cite/491) due to a lack of age-verification mechanisms as well as other personal data collection concerns. Another recent court ruling related to privacy found in favor of Uber drivers [alleging that the platform violated the drivers‚Äô data rights](/cite/354/#r2903) in a number of instances.
