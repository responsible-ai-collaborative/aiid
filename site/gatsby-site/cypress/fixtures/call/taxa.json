				"description": "# What is the CSET Taxonomy?\n\nThe Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) taxonomy is a general taxonomy of AI incidents. There are a large number of classified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, industry, geography, timing, and cost.All classifications within the CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and reviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are finalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and the completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET taxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, the CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to report any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the [Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work similarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. Use the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to find the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click the desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven research at the intersection of security and technology, providing nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is currently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET seeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read more)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

There are a large number of \nclassified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, \nindustry, geography, timing, and cost. All classifications within \nthe CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and \nreviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are \nfinalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and \nthe completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET \ntaxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, \nthe CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to \nreport any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the \n[Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work\nsimilarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. \nUse the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to \nfind the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click \nthe desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s \nWalsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven \nresearch at the intersection of security and technology, \nproviding nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is \ncurrently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial \nintelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET \nseeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address \nthe challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read \nmore)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

There are a large number of \nclassified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, \nindustry, geography, timing, and cost. All classifications within \nthe CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and \nreviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are \nfinalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and \nthe completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET \ntaxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, \nthe CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to \nreport any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the \n[Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work\nsimilarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. \nUse the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to \nfind the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click \nthe desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s \nWalsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven \nresearch at the intersection of security and technology, \nproviding nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is \ncurrently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial \nintelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET \nseeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address \nthe challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read \nmore)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

There are a large number of \nclassified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, \nindustry, geography, timing, and cost. All classifications within \nthe CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and \nreviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are \nfinalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and \nthe completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET \ntaxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, \nthe CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to \nreport any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the \n[Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work\nsimilarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. \nUse the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to \nfind the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click \nthe desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s \nWalsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven \nresearch at the intersection of security and technology, \nproviding nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is \ncurrently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial \nintelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET \nseeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address \nthe challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read \nmore)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

There are a large number of \nclassified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, \nindustry, geography, timing, and cost. All classifications within \nthe CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and \nreviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are \nfinalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and \nthe completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET \ntaxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, \nthe CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to \nreport any errors you may discover in its application.\n\n## How do I explore the taxonomy?\n\nAll taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the \n[Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work\nsimilarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. \nUse the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to \nfind the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click \nthe desired value to apply the filter.\n\n# About CSET\n\nA policy research organization within Georgetown University’s \nWalsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven \nresearch at the intersection of security and technology, \nproviding nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is \ncurrently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial \nintelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET \nseeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address \nthe challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read \nmore)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/).",

The taxonomy filters work similarly to how \nyou filter products on an E-commerce website. Use the search \nfield at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to find the \ntaxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click the \ndesired value to apply the filter.\n\n## About the Responsible AI Collaborative\n\nThe AI Incident Database is a collaborative project of many \npeople and organizations. Details on the people and organizations \ncontributing to this particular taxonomy will appear here, while \nyou can learn more about the Collab itself on the incident \ndatabase [home](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) and \n[about](https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/) pages.\n\nThe maintainers of this taxonomy include,\n\n* [Nikiforos Pittaras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikiforos-pittaras/)\n* [Sean McGregor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanbmcgregor/)",
