    # What is the CSET Taxonomy?

    The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) taxonomy is
    a general taxonomy of AI incidents. There are a large number of 
    classified attributes, including ones pertaining to safety, fairness, 
    industry, geography, timing, and cost. All classifications within 
    the CSET taxonomy are first applied by one CSET annotator and 
    reviewed by another CSET annotator before the classifications are 
    finalized. The combination of a rigorously defined coding set and 
    the completeness with which it has been applied make the CSET 
    taxonomy the AIID's gold standard for taxonomies. Nevertheless, 
    the CSET taxonomy is an ongoing effort and you are invited to 
    report any errors you may discover in its application.

    ## How do I explore the taxonomy?

    All taxonomies can be used to filter incident reports within the 
    [Discover Application](/apps/discover). The taxonomy filters work
    similarly to how you filter products on an E-commerce website. 
    Use the search field at the bottom of the “Classifications” tab to 
    find the taxonomy field you would like to filter with, then click 
    the desired value to apply the filter.

    # About CSET

    A policy research organization within Georgetown University’s 
    Walsh School of Foreign Service, CSET produces data-driven 
    research at the intersection of security and technology, 
    providing nonpartisan analysis to the policy community. CSET is 
    currently focusing on the effects of progress in artificial 
    intelligence (AI), advanced computing and biotechnology. CSET 
    seeks to prepare a new generation of decision-makers to address 
    the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies. [(Read

        This is a freeform field that can have any value. There could be multiple entries for this field.

        Common ones include

          - still images
          - video
          - text
          - speech
          - Personally Identifiable Information
          - structured data
          - other
          - unclear

        Still images are static images. Video images consist of moving images. Text and speech data are considered an important category of unstructured data. They consist of written and spoken words that are not in a tabular format. Personally identifiable information is data that can uniquely identify an individual and may contain sensitive information. Structured data is often in a tabular, machine readable format and can typically be used by an AI system without much preprocessing.

        Avoid using ‘unstructured data’ data in this field. Instead specify the type of unstructured data; text, images, audio files, etc. It is ok to use ‘structured data’ in this field.

        Record what the media report explicitly states. If the report does not explicitly state an input modality but it is likely that a particular kind of input contributed to the harm or near harm, record that input. If you are still unsure, do not record anything.

        The application area of an AI is the high level task that the AI is intended to perform. It does not describe the technical methods by which the AI performs the task. Considering what an AI’s technical methods enable it to do is another way of arriving at what an AI’s application is. 

        It is possible for multiple application areas to be involved. When possible pick the principle or domain area, but it is ok to select multiple areas.
