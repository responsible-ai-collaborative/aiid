## Why "AI Incidents"?

Intelligent systems are currently prone to unforeseen and often dangerous failures when they are deployed to the real world. Much like the transportation sector before it (e.g., [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident/) and [FARS](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)) and more recently [computer systems](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), intelligent systems require a repository of problems experienced in the real world so that future researchers and developers may mitigate or avoid repeated bad outcomes.

## What is an Incident?

The initial set of more than 1,000 incident reports have been intentionally broad in nature. Current examples include,

* An *autonomous car* [kills a pedestrian](/cite/4)
* A *trading algorithm* causes a market "[flash crash](/cite/28)" where billions of dollars transfer between parties
* A *facial recognition system* [causes an innocent person to be arrested](/cite/74)

You are invited to [explore the incidents collected to date](/apps/discover), [view the complete listing](/summaries/incidents), and [submit](/apps/submit) additional incident reports. Researchers are invited to review our [working definition of AI incidents](/research/1-criteria).

## Current and Future Users

The database is a constantly evolving data product and collection of applications.

* **Current Users** include system architects, industrial product developers, public relations managers, [researchers](/research), and public policy researchers. These users are invited to use the [Discover](/apps/discover) application to proactively discover how recently deployed intelligent systems have produced unexpected outcomes in the real world. In so doing, they may avoid making similar mistakes in their development.
* **Future Uses** will [evolve](/research/2-roadmap) through the code contributions of the [open source](https://github.com/responsible-ai-collaborative/aiid) community, including additional database [summaries](/about_apps/) and [taxonomies](/research/2-roadmap).

## When Should You Report an Incident?

When in doubt of whether an event qualifies as an incident, please [submit it](/apps/submit)! This project is intended to converge on a [shared definition](/research/1-criteria) of "AI Incident" through exploration of the candidate incidents submitted by the broader community.

## Board of Directors

The incident database is managed in a participatory manner by persons and organizations contributing code, research, and broader impacts. If you would like to participate in the governance of the project, please [contact](/contact) us and include your intended contribution to the AI Incident Database.

CASMI is focused on operationalizing the design and evaluation of AI systems from the perspective of their impact on human life and safety.
**Contributions:** Kris is developing a collaborative project centered on the case studies of incidents.

**Emeritus Board**

Emeritus board members are those that have particularly distinguished themselves in their service to the Responsible AI Collaborative. They hold no governance position within the organization.

* **[Sean McGregor](https://seanbmcgregor.com/):** Sean McGregor founded the AI Incident Database project and recently joined the [Digital Safety Research Institute](https://ul.org/research/digital-safety) as a founding director. Prior to starting the Responsible AI Collaborative, Sean left a position as machine learning architect at the neural accelerator startup Syntiant so he could focus on the assurance of intelligent systems full time. Dr. McGregor's work spans neural accelerators for energy efficient inference, deep learning for speech and heliophysics, and reinforcement learning for wildfire suppression policy. Outside his paid work, Sean organized a series of workshops at major academic AI conferences on the topic of "AI for Good" and now seeks to safely realize the benefits of AI by bridging AI incident records to AI test programs.
