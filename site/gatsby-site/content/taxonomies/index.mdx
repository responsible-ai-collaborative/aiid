## About Taxonomies ##

Taxonomies are contributed to the AI Incident Database by persons and organizations working to structure the data and provide views into the data. Each taxonomy must be of sufficient quality and completeness to be included in the AI Incident Database, but the taxonomies are the responsibility of the persons and organizations contributing them.
