          text: "For Starbucks (SBUX) barista Kylei Weisse, working at the coffee chain helps him secure health insurance and some extra money while he studies at Georgia Perimeter College. What it doesn't provide is the kind of stable schedule that the company promised its workers last year.\n\n\"It's the wild inconsistency\" of the hours that's a problem, Weisse, 32, said. \"We're supposed to get them 10 days in advance, which often happens, but there's no guarantee. If our manager doesn't get it to us on time, we just have to deal with it.\"\n\nThat became a problem recently when Weisse's manager gave him only a few days notice on his work hours, which ended up conflicting with an anatomy and physiology exam at his college. Weisse ended up paying another worker $20 to take his shift so he could take the exam.\n\nThe short notice is especially frustrating because of Starbucks' vow last year to post employees' schedules at least 10 days in advance, as well as the company's insistence that workers provide at least one-month notice when they need to take a day off.\n\nWhat's behind Starbucks price increases?\n\nWeisse isn't alone in complaining that Starbucks isn't living up to its promises to overhaul its labor practices for its roughly 130,000 baristas. That vow followed an article last year by The New York Times that detailed how workers were struggling to manage childcare and other obligations when the company provided only a few days notice about their schedules.\n\nAbout half of roughly 200 Starbucks baristas in a recent survey said they are still receiving their schedule with less than one week's notice. Others also reported being asked to handle \"clopens,\" split shifts in which employees work a closing shift late into the evening and then an early opening shift the following morning. The company last year promised to end the practice.\n\nOf course, Starbucks isn't alone in using \"just-in-time\" scheduling, with the retail and restaurant industry increasingly turning to software that allows them to change work schedules at the last minute, depending on whether business picks up or slows down. But it is Starbucks that has become a lightning rod on the issue given its vows to improve how it treats employees and its own emphatic claims to valuing workers, whom it labels \"partners.\"\n\n\"Starbucks has the values and wants to do right by their employees,\" said Carrie Gleason, director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group focused on workers'rights, and a co-author of the group's new report on the company's labor practices. \"However, since last year when the company recognized there was a serious problem with the way it scheduled workers and pledged to reform, still so many of the same issues persist.\"\n\nStarbucks didn't respond to requests for comment on the study or on baristas' reports of labor practices that are failing to meet the company's stated goals.\n\nIn an internal memo this week published by Time, Starbucks executive Cliff Burrows wrote that the company couldn't validate the survey, but added that \"the findings suggest, contrary to the expectations we have in place, that some partners are receiving their schedules less than one week in advance and that there is a continuing issue with some partners working a close and then an opening shift the following morning.\" He asks store managers \"to go the extra mile to ensure partners have a consistent schedule.\"\n\nStarbucks ends \"race together\" campaign amid public backlash\n\nTo be sure, some Starbucks workers are receiving at least 10 days notice on their work hours, with the survey finding that about one-third receive two weeks notice and another 18 percent get their schedules three weeks in advance. But that leaves almost half of workers who only receive one week's notice, making it more difficult from them manage other obligations, such as school, family commitments or other jobs.\n\nClopens remain a problem, as well. About 60 percent of workers who have to handle a clopen receive seven or fewer hours of rest between a closing and an opening shift, the study found.\n\nThat's prompted one former Starbucks employee to start a petition to end the practice of scheduling clopens. Ciara Moran noted in her petition that she sometimes was only able to get four or five hours of sleep on the days she was scheduled for clopens. She said she quit her job because she doubted whether it was possible to get ahead given the demands on workers.\n\nEven if Starbucks stuck with its policy of providing eight hours between shifts, that's not enough time, especially given that many workers in the service sector have long commutes, the study said.\n\nAnother issue singled out by the report is Starbucks' practices on sick time. Since paid time off is only available to workers with at least a year on the job, about 40 percent of employees in the survey said they had dealt with barriers in taking sick days.\n\nIn a perfect world, Weisse said he'd like to receive his schedule either a month or a",

                "For Starbucks (SBUX) barista Kylei Weisse, working at the coffee chain helps him secure health insurance and some extra money while he studies at Georgia Perimeter College. What it doesn't provide is the kind of stable schedule that the company promised its workers last year.\n\n\"It's the wild inconsistency\" of the hours that's a problem, Weisse, 32, said. \"We're supposed to get them 10 days in advance, which often happens, but there's no guarantee. If our manager doesn't get it to us on time, we just have to deal with it.\"\n\nThat became a problem recently when Weisse's manager gave him only a few days notice on his work hours, which ended up conflicting with an anatomy and physiology exam at his college. Weisse ended up paying another worker $20 to take his shift so he could take the exam.\n\nThe short notice is especially frustrating because of Starbucks' vow last year to post employees' schedules at least 10 days in advance, as well as the company's insistence that workers provide at least one-month notice when they need to take a day off.\n\nWhat's behind Starbucks price increases?\n\nWeisse isn't alone in complaining that Starbucks isn't living up to its promises to overhaul its labor practices for its roughly 130,000 baristas. That vow followed an article last year by The New York Times that detailed how workers were struggling to manage childcare and other obligations when the company provided only a few days notice about their schedules.\n\nAbout half of roughly 200 Starbucks baristas in a recent survey said they are still receiving their schedule with less than one week's notice. Others also reported being asked to handle \"clopens,\" split shifts in which employees work a closing shift late into the evening and then an early opening shift the following morning. The company last year promised to end the practice.\n\nOf course, Starbucks isn't alone in using \"just-in-time\" scheduling, with the retail and restaurant industry increasingly turning to software that allows them to change work schedules at the last minute, depending on whether business picks up or slows down. But it is Starbucks that has become a lightning rod on the issue given its vows to improve how it treats employees and its own emphatic claims to valuing workers, whom it labels \"partners.\"\n\n\"Starbucks has the values and wants to do right by their employees,\" said Carrie Gleason, director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group focused on workers'rights, and a co-author of the group's new report on the company's labor practices. \"However, since last year when the company recognized there was a serious problem with the way it scheduled workers and pledged to reform, still so many of the same issues persist.\"\n\nStarbucks didn't respond to requests for comment on the study or on baristas' reports of labor practices that are failing to meet the company's stated goals.\n\nIn an internal memo this week published by Time, Starbucks executive Cliff Burrows wrote that the company couldn't validate the survey, but added that \"the findings suggest, contrary to the expectations we have in place, that some partners are receiving their schedules less than one week in advance and that there is a continuing issue with some partners working a close and then an opening shift the following morning.\" He asks store managers \"to go the extra mile to ensure partners have a consistent schedule.\"\n\nStarbucks ends \"race together\" campaign amid public backlash\n\nTo be sure, some Starbucks workers are receiving at least 10 days notice on their work hours, with the survey finding that about one-third receive two weeks notice and another 18 percent get their schedules three weeks in advance. But that leaves almost half of workers who only receive one week's notice, making it more difficult from them manage other obligations, such as school, family commitments or other jobs.\n\nClopens remain a problem, as well. About 60 percent of workers who have to handle a clopen receive seven or fewer hours of rest between a closing and an opening shift, the study found.\n\nThat's prompted one former Starbucks employee to start a petition to end the practice of scheduling clopens. Ciara Moran noted in her petition that she sometimes was only able to get four or five hours of sleep on the days she was scheduled for clopens. She said she quit her job because she doubted whether it was possible to get ahead given the demands on workers.\n\nEven if Starbucks stuck with its policy of providing eight hours between shifts, that's not enough time, especially given that many workers in the service sector have long commutes, the study said.\n\nAnother issue singled out by the report is Starbucks' practices on sick time. Since paid time off is only available to workers with at least a year on the job, about 40 percent of employees in the survey said they had dealt with barriers in taking sick days.\n\nIn a perfect world, Weisse said he'd like to receive his schedule either a month or a",

          text: 'Cuando el covid-19 golpeó Europa en marzo de 2020, los hospitales se sumieron en una crisis sanitaria que aún se entendía mal. “Los médicos realmente no tenían idea de cómo manejar a estos pacientes”, dice Laure Wynants, una epidemióloga de la Universidad de Maastricht en los Países Bajos, que estudia herramientas predictivas.\n\nPero había datos provenientes de China, que tenía una ventaja de cuatro meses en la carrera para vencer la pandemia. Si los algoritmos de aprendizaje automático pudieran entrenarse con esos datos para ayudar a los médicos a entender lo que estaban viendo y tomar decisiones, podría salvar vidas. “Pensé, `Si hay algún momento en que la IA podría demostrar su utilidad, es ahora`”, dice Wynants. “Tenía mis esperanzas altas.”\n\nNunca sucedió, pero no por falta de esfuerzo. Equipos de investigación de todo el mundo se ofrecieron para ayudar. La comunidad de IA, en particular, se apresuró a desarrollar software que muchos creían permitiría a los hospitales diagnosticar o clasificar a los pacientes más rápido, brindando el tan necesario apoyo a las líneas del frente, en teoría.\n\nAl final, se desarrollaron muchos cientos de herramientas predictivas. Ninguna de ellas hizo una diferencia real, y algunas fueron potencialmente dañinas.\n\nEsa es la condenatoria conclusión de múltiples estudios publicados en los últimos meses. En junio, el Instituto Turing, el centro nacional de ciencia de datos e IA del Reino Unido, publicó un informe que resumía las discusiones en una serie de talleres que realizó a finales de 2020. El claro consenso fue que las herramientas de IA habían tenido poco, si es que algún, impacto en la lucha contra el covid.\n\nNo aptas para uso clínico\n\nEsto refleja los resultados de dos estudios importantes que evaluaron cientos de herramientas predictivas desarrolladas el año pasado. Wynants es la autora principal de uno de ellos, una revisión en el British Medical Journal que aún se está actualizando a medida que se lanzan nuevas herramientas y se prueban las existentes. Ella y sus colegas han examinado 232 algoritmos para diagnosticar pacientes o predecir qué tan enfermos podrían llegar a estar aquellos con la enfermedad. Encontraron que ninguno de ellos era apto para uso clínico. Solo dos han sido señalados como lo suficientemente prometedores para futuras pruebas.\n\n“Es impactante”, dice Wynants. “Entré en esto con algunas preocupaciones, pero esto superó mis temores.”\n\nEl estudio de Wynants está respaldado por otra gran revisión realizada por Derek Driggs, un investigador de aprendizaje automático en la Universidad de Cambridge, y sus colegas, y publicada en Nature Machine Intelligence. Este equipo se centró en modelos de aprendizaje profundo para diagnosticar covid y predecir el riesgo de los pacientes a partir de imágenes médicas, como radiografías de tórax y tomografías computarizadas (TC) de tórax. Examinaron 415 herramientas publicadas y, al igual que Wynants y sus colegas, concluyeron que ninguna era apta para uso clínico.\n\n“Esta pandemia fue una gran prueba para la IA y la medicina”, dice Driggs, quien está trabajando en una herramienta de aprendizaje automático para ayudar a los médicos durante la pandemia. “Habría sido un gran paso para conseguir que el público estuviera de nuestro lado”, dice. “Pero no creo que hayamos pasado esa prueba.”\n\nAmbos equipos encontraron que los investigadores repitieron los mismos errores básicos en la forma en que entrenaron o probaron sus herramientas. Suposiciones incorrectas sobre los datos a menudo significaban que los modelos entrenados no funcionaban como se afirmaba.\n\nWynants y Driggs todavía creen que la IA tiene el potencial de ayudar. Pero les preocupa que pueda ser perjudicial si se construye de la manera incorrecta porque podrían perder diagnósticos o subestimar el riesgo para los pacientes vulnerables. “Hay mucho bombo sobre los modelos de aprendizaje automático y lo que pueden hacer hoy”, dice Driggs.\n\nLas expectativas poco realistas fomentan el uso de estas herramientas antes de que estén listas. Wynants y Driggs dicen que algunos de los algoritmos que examinaron ya se han utilizado en hospitales, y algunos están siendo comercializados por desarrolladores privados. “Temo que puedan haber perjudicado a los pacientes”, dice Wynants.\n\nEntonces, ¿qué salió mal? ¿Y cómo cerramos esa brecha? Si hay un lado positivo, es que la pandemia ha dejado claro para muchos investigadores que la forma en que se construyen las herramientas de IA necesita cambiar. “La pandemia ha puesto en el centro de atención problemas que hemos estado arrastrando durante algún tiempo”, dice Wynants.\n\nQué salió mal\n\nMuchos de los problemas que se descubrieron están relacionados con la mala calidad de los datos que los investigadores utilizaron para desarrollar sus herramientas. La información sobre los pacientes con covid, incluidas las imágenes médicas, se recopiló y compartió en medio de una pandemia global, a menudo por los médicos que luchaban por tratar a esos pacientes. Los investigadores querían ayudar rápidamente, y estos eran los únicos conjuntos de datos públicos disponibles. Pero esto significaba que muchas herramientas se construyeron utilizando datos mal etiquetados o datos de fuentes desconocidas.\n\nDriggs destaca el problema de lo que él llama conjuntos de datos Frankenstein, que se ensamblan a partir de múltiples fuentes y pueden contener duplicados. Esto significa que algunas herramientas terminan siendo probadas con los mismos datos con los que fueron entrenadas, haciéndolas parecer más precisas de lo que son.\n\nTambién ensucia el origen de ciertos conjuntos de datos. Esto puede significar que los investigadores pierdan características importantes que sesgan el entrenamiento de sus modelos. Muchos usaron sin saberlo un conjunto de datos que contenía escaneos de tórax de niños que no tenían covid como sus ejemplos de cómo se veían los casos no covid. Pero como resultado, las IAs aprendieron a identificar niños, no covid.\n\nEl grupo de Driggs entrenó su propio modelo utilizando un conjunto de datos que contenía una mezcla de escaneos tomados cuando los pacientes estaban acostados y de pie. Debido a que los pacientes escaneados mientras estaban acostados tenían más probabilidades de estar gravemente enfermos, la IA aprendió erróneamente a predecir un riesgo grave de covid a partir de la posición de una persona.\n\nEn otros casos, se encontró que algunas IAs estaban detectando la fuente de texto que ciertos hospitales usaban para etiquetar los escaneos. Como resultado, las fuentes de los hospitales con casos más graves se convirtieron en predictores de riesgo de covid.\n\nErrores como estos parecen obvios en retrospectiva. También pueden corregirse ajustando los modelos, si los investigadores son conscientes de ellos. Es posible reconocer las deficiencias y lanzar un modelo menos preciso, pero menos engañoso. Pero muchas herramientas fueron desarrolladas ya sea por investigadores de IA que carecían de la experiencia médica para detectar fallas en los datos o por investigadores médicos que carecían de las habilidades matemáticas para compensar esas fallas.\n\nUn problema más sutil que destaca Driggs es el sesgo de incorporación, o sesgo introducido en el punto en que se etiqueta un conjunto de datos. Por ejemplo, muchas imágenes médicas se etiquetaron según si los radiólogos que las crearon dijeron que mostraban covid. Pero eso incrusta, o incorpora, cualquier sesgo de ese médico en particular en la verdad fundamental de un conjunto de datos. Sería mucho mejor etiquetar una imagen médica con el resultado de una prueba PCR en lugar de la opinión de un médico, dice Driggs. Pero no siempre hay tiempo para sutilezas estadísticas en hospitales ocupados.\n\nEso no ha impedido que algunas de estas herramientas se apresuren a entrar en la práctica clínica. Wynants dice que no está claro cuáles se están utilizando o cómo. Los hospitales a veces dicen que están usando una herramienta solo con fines de investigación, lo que hace difícil evaluar cuánto dependen de ellas los médicos. “Hay mucho secreto”, dice.\n\nWynants le pidió a una empresa que estaba comercializando algoritmos de aprendizaje profundo que compartiera información sobre su enfoque, pero no recibió respuesta. Más tarde encontró varios modelos publicados de investigadores vinculados a esta empresa, todos ellos con un alto riesgo de sesgo. “No sabemos realmente qué implementó la empresa”, dice.\n\nSegún Wynants, algunos hospitales incluso están firmando acuerdos de confidencialidad con proveedores de IA médica. Cuando les preguntó a los médicos qué algoritmos o software estaban usando, a veces le dijeron que no se les permitía decirlo.\n\nCómo solucionarlo\n\n¿Cuál es la solución? Mejores datos ayudarían, pero en tiempos de crisis eso es mucho pedir. Es más importante aprovechar al máximo los conjuntos de datos que tenemos. El movimiento más simple sería que los equipos de IA colaboraran más con los clínicos, dice Driggs. Los investigadores también necesitan compartir sus modelos y divulgar cómo fueron entrenados para que otros puedan probarlos y construir sobre ellos. “Esas son dos cosas que podríamos hacer hoy”, dice. “Y resolverían tal vez',

If machine-learning algorithms could be trained on that data to help doctors understand what they were seeing and make decisions, it just might save lives. “I thought, ‘If there’s any time that AI could prove its usefulness, it’s now,’” says Wynants. “I had my hopes up.”\n\nIt never happened—but not for lack of effort. Research teams around the world stepped up to help. The AI community, in particular, rushed to develop software that many believed would allow hospitals to diagnose or triage patients faster, bringing much-needed support to the front lines—in theory.\n\nIn the end, many hundreds of predictive tools were developed. None of them made a real difference, and some were potentially harmful.\n\nThat’s the damning conclusion of multiple studies published in the last few months. In June, the Turing Institute, the UK’s national center for data science and AI, put out a report summing up discussions at a series of workshops it held in late 2020. The clear consensus was that AI tools had made little, if any, impact in the fight against covid.\n\nNot fit for clinical use\n\nThis echoes the results of two major studies that assessed hundreds of predictive tools developed last year. Wynants is lead author of one of them, a review in the British Medical Journal that is still being updated as new tools are released and existing ones tested. She and her colleagues have looked at 232 algorithms for diagnosing patients or predicting how sick those with the disease might get. They found that none of them were fit for clinical use. Just two have been singled out as being promising enough for future testing.\n\n“It’s shocking,” says Wynants. “I went into it with some worries, but this exceeded my fears.”\n\nWynants’s study is backed up by another large review carried out by Derek Driggs, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues, and published in Nature Machine Intelligence. This team zoomed in on deep-learning models for diagnosing covid and predicting patient risk from medical images, such as chest x-rays and chest computer tomography (CT) scans. They looked at 415 published tools and, like Wynants and her colleagues, concluded that none were fit for clinical use.\n\n“This pandemic was a big test for AI and medicine,” says Driggs, who is himself working on a machine-learning tool to help doctors during the pandemic. “It would have gone a long way to getting the public on our side,” he says. “But I don’t think we passed that test.”\n\nBoth teams found that researchers repeated the same basic errors in the way they trained or tested their tools. Incorrect assumptions about the data often meant that the trained models did not work as claimed.\n\nWynants and Driggs still believe AI has the potential to help. But they are concerned that it could be harmful if built in the wrong way because they could miss diagnoses or underestimate risk for vulnerable patients. “There is a lot of hype about machine-learning models and what they can do today,” says Driggs.\n\nUnrealistic expectations encourage the use of these tools before they are ready. Wynants and Driggs both say that a few of the algorithms they looked at have already been used in hospitals, and some are being marketed by private developers. “I fear that they may have harmed patients,” says Wynants.\n\nSo what went wrong? And how do we bridge that gap? If there’s an upside, it is that the pandemic has made it clear to many researchers that the way AI tools are built needs to change. “The pandemic has put problems in the spotlight that we’ve been dragging along for some time,” says Wynants.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nMany of the problems that were uncovered are linked to the poor quality of the data that researchers used to develop their tools. Information about covid patients, including medical scans, was collected and shared in the middle of a global pandemic, often by the doctors struggling to treat those patients. Researchers wanted to help quickly, and these were the only public data sets available. But this meant that many tools were built using mislabeled data or data from unknown sources.\n\nDriggs highlights the problem of what he calls Frankenstein data sets, which are spliced together from multiple sources and can contain duplicates. This means that some tools end up being tested on the same data they were trained on, making them appear more accurate than they are.\n\nIt also muddies the origin of certain data sets. This can mean that researchers miss important features that skew the training of their models. Many unwittingly used a data set that contained chest scans of children who did not have covid as their examples of what non-covid cases looked like. But as a result, the AIs learned to identify kids, not covid.\n\nDriggs’s group trained its own model using a data set that contained a mix of scans taken when patients were lying down and standing up. Because patients scanned while lying down were more likely to be seriously ill, the AI learned wrongly to predict serious covid risk from a person’s position.\n\nIn yet other cases, some AIs were found to be picking up on the text font that certain hospitals used to label the scans. As a result, fonts from hospitals with more serious caseloads became predictors of covid risk.\n\nErrors like these seem obvious in hindsight. They can also be fixed by adjusting the models, if researchers are aware of them. It is possible to acknowledge the shortcomings and release a less accurate, but less misleading model. But many tools were developed either by AI researchers who lacked the medical expertise to spot flaws in the data or by medical researchers who lacked the mathematical skills to compensate for those flaws.\n\nA more subtle problem Driggs highlights is incorporation bias, or bias introduced at the point a data set is labeled. For example, many medical scans were labeled according to whether the radiologists who created them said they showed covid. But that embeds, or incorporates, any biases of that particular doctor into the ground truth of a data set. It would be much better to label a medical scan with the result of a PCR test rather than one doctor’s opinion, says Driggs. But there isn’t always time for statistical niceties in busy hospitals.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped some of these tools from being rushed into clinical practice. Wynants says it isn’t clear which ones are being used or how. Hospitals will sometimes say that they are using a tool only for research purposes, which makes it hard to assess how much doctors are relying on them. “There’s a lot of secrecy,” she says.\n\nWynants asked one company that was marketing deep-learning algorithms to share information about its approach but did not hear back. She later found several published models from researchers tied to this company, all of them with a high risk of bias. “We don’t actually know what the company implemented,” she says.\n\nAccording to Wynants, some hospitals are even signing nondisclosure agreements with medical AI vendors. When she asked doctors what algorithms or software they were using, they sometimes told her they weren’t allowed to say.\n\nHow to fix it\n\nWhat’s the fix? Better data would help, but in times of crisis that’s a big ask. It’s more important to make the most of the data sets we have. The simplest move would be for AI teams to collaborate more with clinicians, says Driggs. Researchers also need to share their models and disclose how they were trained so that others can test them and build on them. “Those are two things we could do today,” he says. “And they would solve mayb',
