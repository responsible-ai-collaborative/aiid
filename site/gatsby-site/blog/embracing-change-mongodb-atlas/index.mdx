When MongoDB announced the deprecation of their Atlas GraphQL and Hosting services ([official announcement](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deprecating-mongodb-atlas-graphql-hosting-services/)), it felt like the rug had been pulled out from under us. At the AI Incident Database (AIID), we had built significant parts of our infrastructure around these services. This is the story of how we adapted, overcame, and emerged stronger.

## Facing the Unexpected

The news hit hard. Like many others ([community reactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb/comments/mongodb_realm_deprecation)), we were initially stunned. Our GraphQL API was central to our operations, and losing it meant we had to quickly find a reliable alternative. We explored popular solutions like Hasura and Apollo, but our past experiences with external dependencies made us cautious. Given our relatively straightforward API requirements, we decided another external dependency wasn't justified.

Instead, we built our own GraphQL solution tailored specifically to our needs. This decision allowed us greater control and flexibility, ensuring our API remains stable and reliable. The transition was smoother than expected, and our new in-house GraphQL API now serves our users effectively without the risk of future disruptions.

Next, we faced the challenge of migrating our authentication system. Again, we initially considered third-party providers such as Clerk and Auth0. However, we quickly realized our authentication requirements were simple enough to manage internally.

We chose NextAuth, a lightweight authentication library that integrates seamlessly with our existing Gatsby infrastructure. This solution proved ideal, offering simplicity, security, and ease of maintenance, perfectly aligning with our needs.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

This experience taught us valuable lessons:

- **Evaluate Dependencies Carefully**: Always consider the trade-offs between external dependencies and in-house solutions.
- **Prioritize Stability and Control**: Solutions within our control significantly reduce future risks and enhance stability.
- **Simplicity is Key**: Simple solutions often lead to more maintainable and resilient systems.

At AIID, we remain dedicated to providing a robust and user-friendly platform for exploring AI incidents. This migration has strengthened our infrastructure and positioned us well for future growth.
