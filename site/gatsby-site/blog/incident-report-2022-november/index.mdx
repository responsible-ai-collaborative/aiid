## üóÑ From the Archives

Every edition, we feature one or more historical incidents that we find thought-provoking.

Given that there has been a lot of news coverage and social media discourse about OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, let‚Äôs take a look back at some of the earlier incidents related to chatbots. Here are just a few:

[Microsoft‚Äôs Tay](/cite/6) was released on March 23, 2016 and removed within 24 hours due to multiple racist, sexist, and anti-semetic tweets generated by the bot.

[Yandex‚Äôs Alice](/cite/58), a chatbot produced by a Russian technology company, released in October 2017 began to reply to questions with racist, pro-Stalin, and pro-violence responses.

[Korean Chatbot Luda](/cite/106) was shown to have used derogatory and bigoted language when asked about lesbians, Black people, and people with disabilities.

[Meta‚Äôs BlenderBot 3](/cite/278) chatbot demo made offensive anti-semitic comments.

Although generative AI technology has become vastly more advanced and wildly popular in only a few years, issues related to bias, discrimination, and ethical use have been persistent problems.
