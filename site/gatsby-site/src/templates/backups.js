        <h2>Citing a Specific Incident</h2>
        <p>
          Every incident has its own suggested citation that credits both the submitter(s) of the
          incident and the editor(s) of the incident. The submitters are the people that submitted
          reports associated with the incident and their names are listed in the order in which
          their submissions were added to the AIID. Since reports can be added to an incident record
          through time, our suggested citation format includes the access date. You can find
          incident citations at <code>https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/INSERT_NUMBER_HERE</code>.
