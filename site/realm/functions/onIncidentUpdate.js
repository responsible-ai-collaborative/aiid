      A Database Trigger will always call a function with a changeEvent.
      Documentation on ChangeEvents: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/change-events/
  
      Access the _id of the changed document:
      const docId = changeEvent.documentKey._id;
  
      Access the latest version of the changed document
      (with Full Document enabled for Insert, Update, and Replace operations):
      const fullDocument = changeEvent.fullDocument;
  
      const updateDescription = changeEvent.updateDescription;
  
      See which fields were changed (if any):
      if (updateDescription) {
        const updatedFields = updateDescription.updatedFields; // A document containing updated fields
      }
  
      See which fields were removed (if any):
      if (updateDescription) {
        const removedFields = updateDescription.removedFields; // An array of removed fields
      }
  
      Functions run by Triggers are run as System users and have full access to Services, Functions, and MongoDB Data.
  
      Access a mongodb service:
      const collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("aiidprod").collection("incidents");
      const doc = collection.findOne({ name: "mongodb" });
  
      Note: In Atlas Triggers, the service name is defaulted to the cluster name.
  
      Call other named functions if they are defined in your application:
      const result = context.functions.execute("function_name", arg1, arg2);
  
      Access the default http client and execute a GET request:
      const response = context.http.get({ url: <URL> })
  
      Learn more about http client here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/functions/context/#context-http
