## 🗄 Trending in the AIID

Making AI tools accessible to the general public can result in a proliferation of unintended uses of the tool. One of the latest examples is the increase in use of generative AI to mimic peoples’ voices without their consent. Incidents [479](/cite/479) and [481](/cite/481) describe this technology being used to create Deepfakes of Joe Rogan and president Joe Biden. Incident [488](/cite/488) describes how the technology is allegedly being used to dox voice actors on Twitter. Finally, a recent [Issue Report](/reports/2639) describes a new chatbot “NoiseGPT” that can turn text into celebrity voices, pointing to more potential incidents in the future.

The proliferation of Deepfakes can create a challenge in tracking incidents as many related reports continue to be published. We have developed a system to manage this using an  incident “[variant](/blog/incidents-issues-variants)”. Assuming the trend of audio deepfakes continues, we will have the ability to index what is likely to become a very large number of deepfake incidents.
