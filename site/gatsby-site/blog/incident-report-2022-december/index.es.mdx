## 🗄 From the Archives

Every edition, we feature one or more historical incidents that we find thought-provoking.

Southwest Airlines’ mass flight cancellations highlighted how extreme weather can disrupt the operations of intelligent systems. The following examples from the AI Incident Database show that this is not the first time weather has interfered with intelligent systems.

In late December 2021, Google Maps directed drivers in the Sierra Nevada area to closed-off and even dangerous roads amid record-setting snowfall (Incident [#155](https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/155)), while in February 2019 Apple Maps allegedly directed a couple on a ski trip in the mountains toward an unconventional route where the drivers found themselves stuck on an unpaved road in the snow (Incident [#288](https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/228)). Self driving cars have also had difficulties navigating snow, as demonstrated in February 2016 when one of Volvo’s autonomous vehicles experienced sensor blindness raising concerns about future issues for self driving cars in snowy regions (Incident [#70](https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/70)).

History has shown that rare and unpredictable circumstances challenge intelligent systems, and the weather will continue to surprise humans and break their computer systems.
