Please note that the content contained within incident reports (e.g., the commentary within a news article) doesnot need to be correct or consistent across articles. If an article is wrong, misleading, or fraudulent, the best response is to submit additional incident reports that correct the record. The incident database is meant to capture the complete state of knowledge and discourse for incidents, not as an arbiter of what happened in individual incidents. In future versions of the database it will additionally be possible to apply tags to incident reports to classify their content.</p><p>Please do NOT flag content if,</p><ul><li>You disagree with the report</li><li>The linked report has disappeared from the web</li><li>The report should not be considered an &quot;incident&quot;</li></ul>"
