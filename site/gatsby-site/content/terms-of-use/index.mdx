## Copyright Policy
RAIC respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify RAIC of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) covers some questions of relevance, including what a notice of possible copyright violation must consist of.

### DMCA TAKEDOWN NOTICES:
It is the policy of RAIC to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement in compliance with the DMCA. In particular, if you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Material infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit RAIC to locate the material;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit the RAIC to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
The United States Copyright Office provides basic information, online, at <https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107>, which can assist one in determining whether an exception or defense, such as fair use, may apply to the use of your copyrighted work.

### COUNTER-NOTIFICATION: RESTORATION OF MATERIAL.
RAIC will immediately remove any infringing content.

The Site offers no warranties or guarantees and the material is presented “as is,” with no further guarantees. RAIC does not make any warranty that our Site will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Site at your own discretion and risk.

In any case, our aggregate liability under these terms shall be limited to $100.

## Jurisdiction
Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Site will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Site that are not otherwise subject to arbitration (as indicated below) will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California.

## Dispute Resolution. 
In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof (collectively, “Disputes”), each party’s senior representatives will engage in good faith negotiations with the other party’s senior representatives to amicably resolve a Dispute (other than for Disputes related to the intellectual property of a party, which will be resolved in litigation before the United States District Court for the Central District of California). If parties are unable to resolve a Dispute within thirty (30) days after the first request to engage in good faith negotiations or within such other time period as the parties may agree to in writing, then either party may commence binding arbitration under JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The parties will share equally the fees and expenses of the JAMS arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator chosen by the mutual agreement of the parties or, failing that, by JAMS under its then prevailing rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant specific performance or any other equitable or legal remedy, including provisional remedies. Each party will be responsible for its own incurred expenses arising out of any dispute resolution procedure. Any arbitration proceedings will take place in Los Angeles, California.

## Entire Agreement
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein. If any part of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Any failure by RAIC to enforce strict performance of any of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy of RAIC in respect of any existing or subsequent breach of these Terms of Use. You must not assign, transfer or otherwise deal with all or part of your rights or obligations under the Terms of Use without RAIC’s written consent.
