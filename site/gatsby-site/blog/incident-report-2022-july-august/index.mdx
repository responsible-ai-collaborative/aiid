*The Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (AIID) contains a wealth of historical instances of AI harms providing insights for the future development and deployment of artificial intelligence. This compilation of AI incidents published in July and August of 2022 highlights emerging incidents and provides a digest of recent additions to the database.*

From troubling bias and censorship concerns to physical injury, July and August saw a variety of headlines from emerging incidents in AI. Chatbots made [offensive](/cite/278) and [accusatory](/cite/313) statements, while a robot infamously [broke a child’s finger](/cite/241) during a match while on camera. Language translation and image rendering software made waves with offensive content.

A deeper dive in the database from the July and August [feed](/rss.xml) reveals a broader variety of incidents. With increasing deployments and competition in the autonomous vehicle space, the number of reports received from United States roads has seen an uptick. The big tech companies like Google and the social networks continue to make news with algorithms gone awry. Adding to this are a variety of new reports on policing and enforcement in the real world showing a variety of bias and safety harms.
